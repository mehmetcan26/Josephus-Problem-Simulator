# Josephus Problem Simulator

Who would be the survivor if a group of soldiers form a ring and starting from the soldier 1  kill the first soldier that is to their left?

## An Example
Lets say there are 5 soldiers so the killing starts with soldier 1 killing soldier 2 then since soldier 2 is dead  it's soldier 3's turn so soldier 3 kills the soldier 4 soldier 5 kills the soldier 1 and at last soldier 3 kills the soldier 5 and since soldier 3 is the only one that's alive the survivor is soldier 3! 

My code is a simulation of the killing process in Josephus Problem (which you can watch the great video on it by Numberphile youtube channel)

If you have suggestions about how the code could be more efficient i would appreciate your help.
